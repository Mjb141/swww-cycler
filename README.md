# SWWW Cycler

`swww-cycler` is a small binary for Hyprland users that will change your background to a random background (from a directory provided) when you move to a new workspace.

## Installation

## Configuration

`swww-cycler` provides a single configuration environment variable:

* `SWWW_CYCLER_LOG_LEVEL` which should be set to one of `info`, `debug`, or `error`.
  * Defaults to `info`, which will only output a single log line per workspace/background change.
